# Docker images for running PHP CI tasks

**Important!** The `*-surf` tags are deprecated and will be removed! Only use the `*-ubuntu` tags. They are identical. 

The packages contain:

* PHP (CLI) with many Extensions
* Composer (at `/usr/local/bin/composer.phar`)
* SSH Client (for running Deployments)
* NodeJS (version 12)
